# Euler Finance Exploit Trap Example

This project demonstrates a trap contract designed to detect a potential exploit similar to the one that affected Euler Finance in March 2023. The trap monitors the DAI balance of a specified address (representing the Euler Finance contract) and triggers an alert if the balance falls below a certain threshold.

## Background: Euler Finance Exploit

On March 13, 2023, Euler Finance, a DeFi lending protocol, suffered a flash loan attack resulting in a loss of approximately \$197 million. The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Euler's liquidation logic, allowing them to drain funds from the protocol.

Key points of the exploit:
1. The attacker used a flash loan to manipulate the protocol's liquidity.
2. They exploited a flaw in the liquidation mechanism to borrow assets without proper collateralization.
3. This resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in the protocol's token balances.

## Trap Contract Explanation

Our `EulerFinanceExploitTrap` contract aims to detect a similar exploit by monitoring the DAI balance of a specified address. Here's how it works:

1. The contract stores the address of the monitored contract (simulating Euler Finance) and the DAI token contract.
2. It defines a threshold (100 million DAI) below which an alert is triggered.
3. The `isValid()` function checks if the DAI balance of the monitored address is below the threshold.
4. If the balance drops below the threshold, it returns `true`, indicating a potential exploit.

## How to Use This Project

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html)
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/asdspal/drosera-trap-examples.git  
cd drosera-trap-examples  


2. Install dependencies:

forge install


### Contract Files

- `src/EulerFinanceExploitTrap.sol`: The main trap contract
- `src/ITrap.sol`: Interface for the trap contract
- `test/EulerFinanceExploitTrap.t.sol`: Test file for the trap contract

### Running Tests

Execute the following command to run the tests:

forge test --match-contract EulerFinanceExploitTrap -vv


This will run two tests:
1. `testNoExploit`: Verifies that the trap doesn't trigger when the balance is above the threshold.
2. `testExploitDetected`: Simulates an exploit by reducing the balance and checks if the trap detects it.

## Potential Real-World Usage

In a real-world scenario, this trap could be integrated into a protocol's risk management system:

1. The trap would continuously monitor the balance of critical contracts.
2. If the balance drops suddenly, it could trigger automated responses such as:
   - Pausing the protocol
   - Alerting the development team
   - Initiating emergency procedures

The `ProtocolWithTrap` contract in `src/ProtocolWithTrap.sol` demonstrates a basic implementation of how a protocol could use this trap to automatically pause operations when an exploit is detected.

## Limitations and Considerations

- This is a simplified example and would need to be adapted for specific protocols.
- The threshold and monitored metrics should be carefully chosen based on the protocol's normal operating parameters.
- Additional checks and balances should be implemented to prevent false positives.
